# 09 -- Poisson's ratio

## Decision

| Material | nu |
|---|---|
| Steel (balls and the steel liner material) | **0.292** |
| Rock | **0.25** |

- **Kept fixed at these values** (confirmed by the author 2026-10-21; all
  values re-checked against the PDFs in Zotero the same day).
- Physical values, used unchanged: the stiffness reduction f = 26
  ([03](03_stiffness_young_modulus.md)) scales Young's moduli only.
- Not calibrated and no sensitivity run of its own: its effect on the
  normal contact stiffness is a few percent, far inside the stiffness range
  tested by V10; the small shift it causes in the tangential / normal
  stiffness ratio is not tested and is argued minor (Analysis). Both depend
  on V10 passing.

## Current state

`pm_dem_sm/config.py:92, 99`: 0.292 / 0.25 -- matches the decision.

## Analysis

- **Effect on the contact.** nu enters Hertz-Mindlin through E* and G*
  (Kishida Table A-1; YADE source). Over Gercek's whole andesite range
  (0.20-0.35) the rock-rock E* changes by -2.3 % to +6.8 % relative to
  nu = 0.25, so collision time and peak overlap (both ~ E*^-0.4) change by
  less than 3 %. The tangential / normal stiffness ratio,
  2 (1 - nu) / (2 - nu), is 0.86 for rock and 0.83 for steel.
- **What V10 covers and what it does not.** nu acts only through the
  contact stiffness. V10 runs the mill with both moduli x0.5 and x2, i.e.
  E* -50 % / +100 %; if toe, shoulder and power are unchanged over that
  fourfold range, a -2.3 % to +6.8 % change of E* from nu cannot change
  them either. V10 scales E for normal and tangential stiffness together,
  so it does **not** test the tangential / normal ratio, which nu shifts by
  about +-8 % over 0.20-0.35 (0.89 to 0.79). That shift is argued minor,
  not demonstrated: in a tumbling charge most tangential behaviour is set
  by the friction limit mu |F_n| once contacts slide, not by the tangential
  spring; no source in the library tests it. The argument holds only if
  V10 passes; if the mill proves stiffness-sensitive, nu must be revisited.
- **Rock value.** The SAG_A-C ore is Chilean porphyry copper ore
  ([03](03_stiffness_young_modulus.md), [08](08_density.md)). 0.25 is
  Vergara et al.'s value for El Teniente andesite, the same source as the
  rock modulus (55 GPa) and density (2850 kg/m^3), so all three rock
  properties come from one source; it also sits inside Gercek's typical
  ranges for andesite (~0.20-0.35), diorite (~0.20-0.30) and granite
  (~0.10-0.33), and at the upper edge of granodiorite (~0.15-0.25) -- the
  igneous host rocks of porphyry copper deposits.
- **Steel value.** 0.292 is Shigley's carbon-steel value, given together
  with the E = 207 GPa used in [03](03_stiffness_young_modulus.md). It also
  applies to the steel liner material ([05](05_friction.md)).
- **Time step.** nu enters the Rayleigh step but not YADE's P-wave step;
  both were computed with these values ([02](02_time_step.md)).

## Verdict and how to defend it

"Poisson's ratios are physical values: 0.292 for carbon steel (Shigley) and
0.25 for the ore, within the typical range for andesite and other igneous
rocks (Gercek 2007, Fig. 4) and equal to the value for El Teniente andesite
(Vergara et al. 2020, Table 1), the same source as the ore modulus and
density. Their influence is limited to the contact stiffness, which changes
by less than 7 % over the typical andesite range -- far less than the
stiffness range over which the mill response was shown to be insensitive
(V10); the accompanying change of the tangential / normal stiffness ratio
(about +-8 %) acts mainly below the friction limit and is considered
minor."

## Note: tangential / normal stiffness ratio

nu also sets the ratio of tangential to normal contact stiffness,
2 (1 - nu) / (2 - nu): 0.89 / 0.86 / 0.79 for rock at nu = 0.20 / 0.25 /
0.35. The stiffness check V10 scales both stiffnesses together and does not
test this ratio. Its effect is expected to be minor because the tangential
spring only matters below the friction limit mu |F_n| (sliding contacts are
friction-limited), but this is an argument, not a tested result. If ever
needed, one run with rock nu = 0.35 at the calibrated point would test it.
nu is kept fixed at the values above.

## Open items

- Depends on V10 ([16](16_validation_checks.md)): if the mill is
  stiffness-sensitive, revisit nu (and its effect on the tangential /
  normal stiffness ratio).
