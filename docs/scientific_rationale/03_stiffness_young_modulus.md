# 03 -- Stiffness (Young's modulus)

## Decision

Both physical Young's moduli are reduced by the **same factor f = 26**
(decided 2026-10-19), preserving the physical steel / rock stiffness ratio:

| Material | Physical E | Source of the physical value | Simulation E = E / 26 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Steel (balls, lifters, shell) | 207 GPa | Shigley, 8th ed., inside-cover table "Constantes fisicas de materiales", carbon steel (PDF p3) | **7.96 GPa** |
| Rock (ore) | 55 GPa | Vergara et al. 2020, Table 1 "Mechanical parameters of intact rock of the CMET lithology", intact rock Young's modulus E_i (manuscript PDF p3) -- **representative value, not site-specific** (see "Ore modulus" below) | **2.115 GPa** |

Steel / rock ratio: 3.76 in both the physical and the simulated set.

**Rule that fixes f = 26:** the smallest uniform reduction for which every
contact type (steel-steel, steel-rock, rock-rock) is integrated with
**>= 20 steps at the worst-case impact speed** sqrt(2 g D) = 15.2 m/s with
dt = 2.5e-5 s ([02](02_time_step.md)), satisfying both the 15-25 steps of
Cleary 2001 and the 20-70 of Boemer & Ponthot 2017. Any stiffer set drops
some contact below 20 steps; any softer set only increases overlap.

Acceptance (all relative to the smaller particle **diameter**):

- **mean** overlap <= 0.5 % (the strictest average in the literature,
  Cleary & Morrison 2016);
- **maximum** overlap < 10 % (Boemer & Ponthot's sensitivity limit); the
  predicted worst case is 3.9 % (3.8 % with rock at 2650 kg/m^3);
- macroscopic results (toe, shoulder, power) unchanged when E is halved or
  doubled (validation check **V10**, [16](16_validation_checks.md)).

## Overlap criteria in the literature

| Source | Criterion | Kind | Relative to | Where |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cleary 2001 | "Typically, average overlaps of 0.1-1.0% are desirable" (hence kn = 8e6 N/m) | average, practice | not stated (diameter in the same group's later papers) | §2, PDF p4 / j.82 |
| Cleary & Morrison 2016 | "Typically, average overlaps of 0.1-0.5% are adequate to ensure a balance between computing speed and realistic predictions" | average, practice | not stated | §2, PDF p3 / j.77 |
| Owen & Cleary 2015 | kn chosen "to give an average overlap of the order of 0.8% of the average particle diameter" | average, used value | average diameter | §3, PDF p3 / j.21 |
| Boemer & Ponthot 2017 | Limit "the average overlap ... to a value between 0.1 and 1 % with respect to the diameter of the ball ... maybe 10 % would still lead to satisfying results" | average, practice | ball diameter | §3.1.2, PDF p8 / j.60 |
| Boemer & Ponthot 2017 | Results "relatively insensitive to the normal stiffness provided that the maximum overlap percentage ... is smaller than about 10 %" | **maximum, measured sensitivity** | diameter | §4, PDF p13 / j.65 |
| Boemer & Ponthot 2017 | Method: maximum overlap from the analytic collision (Eqs. 8-9) at the worst-case impact speed v_r = sqrt(2 g D) (free fall across the mill) | method | -- | §3.1.2, PDF p8 / j.60 |
| Govender 2015 | "Typical DEM simulations use a spring stiffness and time-step that limits the maximum penetration depth to d_max ~ 0.05 r where r is the radius of the smallest particle" (= 2.5 % of its diameter); lifter contacts accepted only for penetration < 5 % of the radius (Algorithm 1) | maximum, practice | smallest radius | §1.5, PDF p6 / j.157; Algorithm 1, PDF p5 / j.156 |
| Kishida 2025, Thakur 2016 | No overlap criterion stated | -- | -- | -- |

Two kinds of number appear: **average** overlaps (practice, 0.1-1 %, the
strictest being 0.1-0.5 %) and **maximum** overlaps (Govender's typical
practice 2.5 % of the diameter; Boemer's tested sensitivity limit ~10 %).
Only Boemer's 10 % is an actual sensitivity result; the others are
customary values.

`min(r1, r2)` (a **radius**), so 1.085 % of the radius is 0.54 % of the
diameter. The papers quote overlap relative to the **diameter**.

## Analysis

### Why a uniform reduction, not slide 12

Slides 9-11 derived each modulus from its own particle radius so that both
materials had the same P-wave critical step (3.25e-5 s for slide 12). That
softened steel by 6.2x and rock by 19.2x, making the simulated steel / rock
stiffness ratio **11.6 instead of the physical 3.8**. Once dt is set by the
steps-per-collision criterion ([02](02_time_step.md)) rather than by equal
critical steps, that construction has no remaining purpose. A uniform
reduction keeps the stiffness *ratio* physical, so the only approximation is
the overall softening -- which is exactly what Boemer & Ponthot's
insensitivity result covers. (That result was obtained with steel balls only,
so it does not by itself show that distorting the steel / rock ratio is
harmless in a mixed charge; the uniform reduction avoids having to argue it.)

### Why f = 26: the admissible range at dt = 2.5e-5 s

| f | E steel / rock | Fewest steps per collision (15.2 m/s) | Max peak overlap (15.2 m/s) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
Rock density 2850 kg/m^3 ([08](08_density.md)); values for the 2650
sensitivity case in brackets where they change the conclusion.

| f | E steel / rock | Fewest steps per collision (15.2 m/s) | Max peak overlap (15.2 m/s) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <= 8.6 | >= 24.1 / 6.40 GPa | <= 13.3 | <= 2.5 % | meets Govender's customary 2.5 %, **fails** Cleary's 15 steps |
| 11.6 | 17.8 / 4.74 GPa | 15.0 | 2.8 % | Cleary's minimum, no margin |
| 23.8 | 8.70 / 2.31 GPa | 20.0 (19.4) | 3.7 % | meets Boemer's 20 at 2850 only, no margin |
| **26** | **7.96 / 2.115 GPa** | **20.7 (20.1)** | **3.9 %** | **meets Cleary and Boemer for every contact at both rock densities** |
| <= 275 | -- | -- | < 10 % | Boemer's overlap limit |

f = 26 is the stiffest uniform set that meets both step criteria for both
rock densities used (2850 baseline, 2650 sensitivity run); f ~ 24 would
suffice at 2850 alone, but keeping 26 lets the two density runs share the
same moduli, so only density changes between them. Softening further gains
nothing but overlap. The range itself shows that no stiffer set
can meet both Cleary's/Boemer's step criteria and Govender's customary 2.5 %
at this dt: the customary 2.5 % would need dt ~ 1.6e-5 s.

### Peak overlaps with f = 26

delta_max = (15 m* v^2 / (16 E* R*^0.5))^(2/5) (Johnson 1985 Eq. 11.22,
p. 353, with E*, R*, m* as defined in Eq. 11.20, p. 352), relative to the
smaller diameter (rock density 2850 kg/m^3; steel-steel independent of it):

| Pair | 1 m/s | 5 m/s | 8 m/s | 12 m/s | **15.2 m/s (worst case)** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| steel-steel | 0.38 % | 1.37 % | 2.00 % | 2.77 % | **3.35 %** |
| steel-rock | 0.44 % | 1.60 % | 2.33 % | 3.22 % | **3.89 %** |
| rock-rock | 0.43 % | 1.57 % | 2.29 % | 3.17 % | **3.83 %** |

The worst case follows Boemer's method: v_r = sqrt(2 g D) =
sqrt(2 x 9.81 x 11.8375) = 15.2 m/s, a particle falling from the top of the
mill to the bottom. Real impacts are slower (the old dataset's fastest
particle moved at 12.6 m/s).

Against the criteria:

- **Maximum overlap.** Worst case 3.4-3.9 %: well below Boemer's ~10 %
  sensitivity limit. Govender's *customary* 2.5 % is exceeded only for
  impacts above ~9 m/s; meeting it would need a stiffer set and dt ~1.6e-5 s,
  which no sensitivity evidence requires.
- **Average overlap.** Average overlaps come from the enduring contacts of the
  bulk charge, loaded by gravity rather than impacts. Slide 10's settled-bed
  check gave a **maximum** of 0.54 % of the diameter for the much softer
  3.5e9 / 3e8 Pa set; static Hertz overlap scales as E^(-2/3), so the f = 26
  set (2.3x stiffer steel, 7x stiffer rock) should settle with maximum
  overlaps of roughly 0.15-0.3 %, and mean overlaps lower still -- inside the
  strictest 0.1-0.5 % average range (Cleary & Morrison). This must be
  measured, not assumed (see open items).

The slide-8 target "< 0.1 %" is below the lower end of every average range
in the library (0.1-0.5 % to 0.1-1 %); it should be replaced by these ranges.

### Ore modulus

The SAG_A/B/C mills grind ore from large Chilean copper operations
(e.g. Caserones, Minera Escondida, Minera Los Pelambres); no measured Young's
modulus of these ores is available. The value used, E_i = 55 GPa, is the
intact-rock modulus of El Teniente (CMET) andesite from Vergara et al. 2020,
Table 1 (manuscript PDF p3), a Chilean porphyry copper deposit ("Veined rock
masses can be found in porphyry copper deposits like at the El Teniente mine
in Chile", abstract). It is therefore a **representative value for hard
igneous rock of a Chilean porphyry copper deposit, not a measurement of the
SAG_A/B/C ores**. Its companion Poisson's ratio (0.25) lies within Gercek's
range for andesite ([09](09_poisson_ratio.md)).

The uncertainty matters little here: the modulus is reduced 26x for
numerical reasons, and V10 tests a factor-2 change in both moduli, which
brackets any plausible difference between this andesite value and the actual
ores.

## Verdict and how to defend it

"Young's moduli start from physical values -- 207 GPa for carbon steel
(Shigley) and 55 GPa for intact andesite of a Chilean porphyry copper deposit
(El Teniente, Vergara et al. 2020, Table 1), used as representative since
the ores of the reference mills were not characterised -- and are reduced by
a common factor of 26, preserving their physical ratio, to 7.96 and
2.115 GPa. In mill DEM the stiffness is a numerical parameter (Cleary &
Morrison 2016, §2); the factor is the smallest for which every collision is
integrated with at least 20 steps at dt = 2.5e-5 s for both ore densities
considered (2850 and 2650 kg/m^3), satisfying the accuracy
criteria of Cleary (2001, §2) and Boemer & Ponthot (2017, §2.2.3). The
maximum overlap, estimated with Hertz theory (Johnson 1985, Eq. 11.22) at
Boemer & Ponthot's worst-case impact speed sqrt(2 g D) = 15.2 m/s, is 3.9 %,
well below the ~10 % up to which charge motion and power are insensitive to
stiffness (Boemer & Ponthot 2017, §4); average overlaps stay within the
0.1-0.5 % of Cleary & Morrison (2016, §2). A sensitivity study with both
moduli halved and doubled confirmed that charge shape and power do not depend
on the stiffness reduction (V10). Measured overlaps: mean X %, max Y %."

Replace the Thakur citation for this argument: Thakur 2016 concerns stiffness
scaling with particle size in coarse-grained DEM, not softening for dt.

## Open items / validation

- Measure mean / P99 / max overlap relative to the diameter, per contact
  pair type, in a steady-rotation run with the f = 26 set.
- **V10** (kept, 2026-10-19): runs at E x 0.5 (f = 52) and E x 2 (f = 13),
  both materials together, 3 revolutions each, same dt = 2.5e-5 s (E x 2
  still gets >= 15.3 steps per collision); toe, shoulder, power and charge
  angle must stay within the replicate scatter (V12).
- Update `config.MATERIALS` and `young_scale`: see C03-1 below.
