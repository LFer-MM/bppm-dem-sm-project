# 05 -- Friction coefficient

## Decision

Friction is the **primary calibration variable**.

- **Particle-particle friction: one uniform mu_p for all three pairs**
  (steel-steel, steel-rock, rock-rock), as in Cleary & Morrison 2016
  (decided 2026-10-20). Baseline mu_p = 0.5. The Owen & Cleary set
  0.4 / 0.5 / 0.8 is run **once as a sensitivity case**, not calibrated.
- Only two friction parameters are calibrated, because there are only two
  targets (plant toe / shoulder, [15](15_calibration_targets.md)): mu_p and a
  particle-liner friction mu_w. Rolling resistance is not a third calibrated
  knob ([06](06_rolling_resistance.md)).
- **Separate liner material** (decided 2026-10-20): shell and lifters get
  their own material "liner" (steel stiffness, density and Poisson ratio;
  its own friction), so mu_w is independent of steel-steel friction. Govender
  et al. 2015 (Table 8) treat lifter friction separately (0.70 vs 0.40 for
  particles) and use it to match the shoulder (§1.6.1).
- Implementation: friction angles in **radians** (mu = tan(angle)), assigned
  per pair with a `frictAngle` `MatchMaker`. Without it YADE takes the
  **minimum** of the two materials' angles, so mu_w could never exceed mu_p:
  the MatchMaker is **required** for the calibration, not only for the Owen
  run.
- **Calibration grid** (decided 2026-10-20): mu_p x mu_w in
  {0.3, 0.5, 0.7} x {0.3, 0.5, 0.7} (9 runs), then refined around the best
  point; mu_w extended to 0.8-0.9 if the shoulder / toe are not reached
  (the SAG_A toe is high for its fill, [15](15_calibration_targets.md)).
  All runs start from **one shared settled initial condition** and spin up
  to a steady charge shape (~6 revolutions, ~1.3 h per run at full scale,
  ~12 h for the grid). Score: simulated bulk toe / shoulder (position-density
  contour) vs. SAG_A.

The sources disagree on sensitivity: Cleary (2D, and Owen quoting it) finds
friction weakly important; Boemer & Ponthot (3D, experimentally validated
lab mill, run in YADE) and Govender (used friction as the tuning knob for the
shoulder) find it decisive. Since this project calibrates against plant charge
shape, friction is treated as the main calibration variable.

## Current state

| Where | What |
|---|---|
| `main` `config.py:91,98` | `"friction_angle": math.atan(0.5)` -> 0.4636 rad (already radians) |
| `main` `yade_dem/materials.py:30` | `frictionAngle=radians(material_properties["friction_angle"])` -> converts **again**: 0.4636 deg -> 0.00809 rad, **mu = 0.0081** |
| `main` engines | No `frictAngle` MatchMaker: steel-rock contacts get min(mu_steel, mu_rock) |
| Branch `worktree-yade-sim-structure` | Double conversion fixed (commit `543208a`) |

Consequence: any run made with `main` -- including, if it used this code,
the 212 deg / 26.5 deg match of slide 31 -- had practically frictionless
particles and liner. The lifters (30 rows) can still lift such a charge,
which is why a plausible toe / shoulder may have been reached, but those
parameters are not valid once friction is correct. The manual friction and
density search of slide 30 must be repeated after the fix.

## Analysis

- Densities are not a calibration variable ([08](08_density.md)); friction
  (and rolling resistance, [06](06_rolling_resistance.md)) is what the
  literature tunes to match the shoulder.
- With spheres, friction alone cannot provide the interlocking of angular
  ore. Cleary & Morrison's mu = 0.5 was used with super-quadric shapes; with
  spheres the same mu gives a weaker charge, which rolling resistance
  compensates.
- **Why exactly two calibrated parameters, and why mu_p and mu_w.** There
  are two targets (bulk toe, shoulder), so at most two parameters can be
  identified; with more, many combinations fit equally well and the
  calibrated values are not unique. The two must act through different
  mechanisms:
  - mu_p (particle-particle) sets the shear strength of the bulk charge:
    cascading and the toe.
  - mu_w (particle-liner) sets how firmly lifters and shell hold the charge
    before release: the shoulder (Govender et al. 2015, §1.6.1, tune lifter
    friction separately for this).
  - Rock rolling resistance also acts on bulk shear strength, almost the
    same mechanism as mu_p; calibrating both would be ill-conditioned, so it
    is fixed separately ([06](06_rolling_resistance.md)) and checked as a
    sensitivity.
- Owen's pair-wise set needs a `frictAngle` MatchMaker in YADE; with
  per-material angles and the min rule, steel-rock would get 0.4, not 0.5.
- **Why uniform mu_p rather than Owen's ratios.** Owen's ordering
  (steel-steel < steel-rock < rock-rock) is the more physically plausible
  one: rock is rough, worn balls are smooth. Uniform mu_p is chosen anyway
  because:
  1. The targets cannot identify the ratio. Toe and shoulder are bulk
     responses; 1 : 1 : 1 and 0.4 : 0.5 : 0.8 (rescaled) fit them equally
     well, so the ratio is an assumption either way. Uniform adds no
     species contrast the data does not support.
  2. Neither set is measured. Owen's values are a modelling choice ("rocks
     are typically quite rough"), and the same group used 0.5 for every pair
     a year later (Cleary & Morrison 2016, Table 2).
  3. Rock roughness is already represented. With spheres, the angularity
     that makes rock-rock contacts strong is modelled by rock rolling
     resistance ([06](06_rolling_resistance.md)); a higher rock-rock mu on
     top would count it twice.
  4. Segregation is the surrogate's output. A friction contrast between
     species acts directly on steel / rock segregation; with uniform mu_p,
     segregation comes only from size and density, which are known.
  5. It needs no MatchMaker for particle pairs (all three equal).
- Cost of the choice: if rock roughness does drive segregation in the real
  mill, uniform mu_p understates it. The Owen sensitivity run checks this.

## Verdict and how to defend it

"Friction is calibrated because it controls the sliding of the charge and the
power draw (Boemer & Ponthot 2017, abstract and §3.1.4) and is the parameter
used to match the shoulder position (Govender et al. 2015, §1.6.1). The
search is bracketed by literature values: mu = 0.5 for all pairs (Cleary &
Morrison 2016, Table 2), 0.4 / 0.5 / 0.8 for steel-steel / steel-rock /
rock-rock (Owen & Cleary 2015, Table 4), 0.575 (Kishida et al. 2025) and
0.40 particle / 0.70 lifter for a SAG mill (Govender et al. 2015, Table 8).
Two parameters are calibrated, one per target mechanism: a uniform
particle-particle friction and a separate particle-liner friction, on a
3 x 3 grid from a shared settled initial condition; the remaining contact
parameters are fixed from the literature and tested one at a time."

On the pair structure: "Owen & Cleary's ordering (steel-steel 0.4,
steel-rock 0.5, rock-rock 0.8; Owen & Cleary 2015, Table 4) is physically
plausible, but the toe / shoulder targets cannot identify the ratios, rock
angularity is represented by rolling resistance, and segregation is the
output of interest. A uniform particle friction is therefore used, as in
Cleary & Morrison 2016 (Table 2), with Owen's set as a sensitivity case."

## Open items / validation

- **Owen sensitivity run** (decided 2026-10-20): after calibration, one run
  with steel-steel / steel-rock / rock-rock = 0.4 / 0.5 / 0.8 scaled so that
  the charge shape stays matched (or plain 0.4 / 0.5 / 0.8 with the
  calibrated mu_w), compared with the uniform case on toe / shoulder and on
  steel / rock segregation. Small change -> uniform mu_p justified; large
  change -> report as a limitation or revisit.
- Restitution for the liner pairs: steel values (liners are steel), decided
  in [07](07_restitution.md).
- Re-measure the packing fraction after calibration ([12](12_charge_fill_and_particles.md)):
  packing depends on friction.

## Pending code changes

| ID | Change | Current code | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| C05-1 | Uniform mu_p: steel and rock get the same `friction_angle` (radians, mu = tan(angle)) from one config value | Per-material `friction_angle`, both atan(0.5) | Before calibration |
| C05-2 | `frictAngle` `MatchMaker` with per-pair friction: particle-liner pairs = mu_w (needed whenever mu_w > mu_p); particle pairs = mu_p, or the Owen set in the sensitivity run | No MatchMaker: pair angle = min of the two materials | Before calibration |
| C05-3 | Add a `"liner"` entry to `MATERIALS` (steel density / young / poisson, friction mu_w) and set `mill.liner_material = "liner"`; add liner-steel / liner-rock restitution pairs; the frictionless `end_wall` material keeps deriving from it | `mill.liner_material = "steel"` (`scenario.py:84`); no liner material in `config.py` | Before calibration |
