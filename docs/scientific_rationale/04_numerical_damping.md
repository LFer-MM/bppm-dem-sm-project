# 04 -- Numerical ("gravity") damping

## Decision

**`NewtonIntegrator.damping = 0` everywhere, at all times** (decided
2026-10-19): filling, settling and packing measurements as well as
calibration and SIC / RMIC dataset runs. Initial conditions are settled by
the physical dissipation of the contact law alone, with a mean-speed stop
rule ([13](13_initial_conditions.md)); particle velocities are zeroed before
an IC is saved.

The value is **always set explicitly** in the code, never left to YADE's
default: the default differs between YADE versions (0.0 in the 3rd-edition
documentation, 0.2 in the `yadedaily` build installed here).

Damping was previously needed only because the integration was unstable
(see "Why damping appeared necessary" below); with the stable dt of
[02](02_time_step.md) it is not.

Energy is dissipated only by the contact law: normal / tangential dashpots set
from restitution ([07](07_restitution.md)), friction ([05](05_friction.md))
and rolling resistance ([06](06_rolling_resistance.md)).

## What YADE's numerical damping does

YADE docs 2021, §2.1 "DEM formulation", "Numerical damping", printed
pp. 70-71 (PDF pp. 77-78), Eq. (2.9): for each particle and each axis
w in {x, y, z}, the force is modified by

(Delta F)_w = -lambda_d sgn(F_w u_dot_w) F_w,

i.e. a force that would **increase** the particle's speed is reduced by the
fraction lambda_d, and a force that would **decrease** it is increased by
lambda_d. With `dampGravity = true` (the default, PDF p277) this applies to
gravity too. Consequences for a particle in free flight with lambda_d = 0.2:

| Phase | Physical acceleration | With damping 0.2 |
|---|---|---|
| Falling (cataracting stream, towards the toe) | g | **0.8 g** |
| Rising (thrown from the shoulder) | g | **1.2 g** |

A particle falling from the shoulder therefore reaches the toe with ~20 %
less kinetic energy than physics dictates, and its trajectory is distorted
-- a direct bias on the toe angle, the impact energies and the mixing that
the datasets are meant to capture.

## Why damping appeared necessary

**Observation (PPT setup):** without damping, particles poured into the mill
collided "explosively" and were shot out of the mill; damping 0.2-0.5 stopped
it.

**Test (2026-10-19, this machine).** The 2 m smoke-test mill
(`configs/simulation/smoke_test.json`, 300 rocks + 60 balls, 8 lifters) was
filled and settled with the branch code and **damping = 0 throughout**, at
five time steps expressed as a fraction of the Rayleigh step
dt_R = 6.13e-4 s of its material set. Escaped = particle centre outside the
shell radius or the slice depth after fill + settle:

| dt / dt_R | dt (s) | Escaped | Max speed | Mean speed at end |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.3 | 1.84e-4 | **0 / 360** | 0.08 m/s | 0.004 m/s (settled) |
| 0.6 | 3.68e-4 | **0 / 360** | 0.21 m/s | 0.033 m/s (settles, but jittery: near the limit) |
| 1.0 | 6.13e-4 | **360 / 360** | 4,187 m/s | 1,687 m/s |
| 1.5 | 9.20e-4 | **360 / 360** | 11,156 m/s | 2,579 m/s |
| 3.0 | 1.84e-3 | **360 / 360** | 10,610 m/s | 5,030 m/s |

Above the stability limit the explicit integration **creates** energy at
every contact (particles leave a collision faster than they entered), and the
charge explodes. Damping "fixed" this only by draining the spurious energy as
fast as it was created -- it masked an unstable time step.

**Where the earlier setups sat** (dimensionless dt / dt_R is what transfers
between the smoke test and the full mill):

| Setup | dt / dt_R | Regime |
|---|---|---|
| `config.py` moduli (155.7 / 13.47 GPa) at dt = 1e-4 s | ~1.2 | explodes |
| PPT slide-12 moduli (33.16 / 2.868 GPa) at dt = 1e-4 s | ~0.55 | at the jittery edge |
| **Decided set (f = 26) at dt = 2.5e-5 s** | **0.11** (0.12 with rock at 2650) | stable with a wide margin |

**Contributing causes on `main`, fixed on the branch:**

- Fill boxes sized from the shell circle ignored the 30 lifters, and boxes
  straddling the mill axis had corners outside the shell: spheres could be
  created overlapping a facet and be ejected through it (facets are thin,
  so a sphere whose centre crosses the facet plane is pushed to the other
  side). The branch keeps fill boxes inside the inner radius minus lifter
  height minus a particle radius, and bounds the box width by the farther
  chord.
- Resized rocks kept the mass of a steel ball (~24x too heavy), making their
  impacts far more energetic. Fixed (mass and inertia recomputed).

## Analysis

- **Purpose of the tool.** YADE's own documentation introduces numerical
  damping for quasi-static simulations with contact laws that lack
  velocity-based damping, and calls the scheme "clearly non-physical". A
  rotating mill is a dynamic, cataracting flow, and the Hertz-Mindlin law
  used here ([01](01_contact_model.md)) has velocity-based damping
  (restitution dashpots). Neither condition for using it holds in the
  rotating runs.
- **Effect on the physics.** With 0.2 the cataracting stream falls at 0.8 g
  and is thrown up at 1.2 g (table above); impacts at the toe lose ~20 % of
  their energy on top of the restitution losses. The charge throws less far,
  the toe moves, and the Cleary & Morrison energy balance (supplied =
  dissipated in contacts) cannot close because part of the energy disappears
  outside the contacts.
- **Effect on calibration.** Any friction / restitution values tuned with
  0.2 compensate for this artefact and are not transferable to undamped
  runs.
- **Why not even during IC settling.** Pouring and settling an IC is a
  quasi-static process -- YADE's intended use -- and its velocities are
  zeroed afterwards, so damping there would leave no trace in the dynamics.
  It is still not used, for two reasons: (1) with a stable dt the contact
  law alone settles the charge (test above: 0 escapes, mean speed 4 mm/s);
  (2) damping changes how the charge packs while it settles, and the
  packing fraction phi measured in that state sets the particle counts
  ([12](12_charge_fill_and_particles.md)). A single damping-free protocol
  for packing measurement, IC generation and dataset runs keeps all three
  consistent.
- **Historical reason.** With YADE's Cundall-Strack law (no dashpot), the
  integrator damping is the only way to dissipate normal-impact energy, which
  explains its use in earlier versions of the setup. With Hertz-Mindlin and
  pair-wise `en` it is not needed.

## Verdict and how to defend it

"No artificial (non-viscous) damping is used at any stage. YADE provides it
for quasi-static problems with contact laws lacking velocity-based damping
and describes it as 'clearly non-physical' (YADE documentation, 3rd ed.,
§2.1 'Numerical damping'); applied to gravity, a coefficient of 0.2 would
make particles fall at 0.8 g and rise at 1.2 g. Energy is dissipated
exclusively through the contact model (restitution, friction, rolling
resistance), as in all the mill DEM studies consulted, where the energy
dissipated in collisions must balance the energy supplied by the mill within
a few percent (Cleary & Morrison 2016, §2) and artificial numerical power is
kept below 1 % (Boemer & Ponthot 2017, §3.1). Damping had earlier appeared
necessary to stop particles being ejected during filling; a test at five
time steps showed this was an integration instability (all particles
ejected at dt >= dt_R, none at dt <= 0.6 dt_R, without damping), which the
chosen dt = 0.11 dt_R avoids. Initial conditions are therefore poured and
settled by contact dissipation alone, with the same protocol used to measure
the packing fraction."

## Open items / validation

- Energy balance per run (V4): integral of power (torque x omega) vs. the
  sum of contact dissipation (YADE energy tracker `O.trackEnergy = True`); see
  [16](16_validation_checks.md).
- V5: assert `NewtonIntegrator.damping == 0` in every stage, set
  explicitly in the code (see C04-1 / C04-2 below; the branch's scenario still
  has `fill.damping` / `settle.damping` = 0.2 defaults).
- V13 (new): zero sphere-sphere and sphere-facet overlaps before the first
  step of every fill batch; abort otherwise.
- Confirm on the first full-scale IC that the charge settles without escapes
  and within an acceptable time (the smoke test covers the physics; the
  dimensionless dt / dt_R is what transfers).
- Fallback only if full-scale settling proves too slow: temporarily lower the
  restitution during IC generation (contact-level, does not distort gravity,
  erased when velocities are zeroed). Not expected to be needed.
- Re-generate the datasets and re-measure phi: those made with 0.2 do not
  represent undamped mill dynamics.

| C04-2 | V5 assertion at the start of every stage | None | With C04-1 |
