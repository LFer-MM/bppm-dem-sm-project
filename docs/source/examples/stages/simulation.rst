DEM simulation
==============

The DEM run happens under YADE's own Python interpreter, which cannot be
imported into this package's environment.
:func:`~bppm_dem_sm.simulation.launcher.launch_simulation` therefore starts
it as a subprocess; this is what ``bppm-dem-sm dem-sim`` and
``do_simulate`` call. ``dem-sim`` does not import pandas or TensorFlow, so it
works on a machine that only has YADE (``yade`` or the ``yadedaily`` build).

Scenarios
---------

A run is described by one JSON file, loaded into a
:class:`~bppm_dem_sm.simulation.scenario.SimulationScenario`: mill geometry
and speed, the two particle species, materials and restitution, contact
law, time step, and the settings of each stage. Keys left out keep their
defaults (which come from :mod:`bppm_dem_sm.config`). Three scenarios ship in
``configs/simulation/``:

``smoke_test.json``
   A 2 m mill with 360 soft particles; runs every stage in under a minute.
   Use it to check the pipeline, not the physics.
``sag_slice_stl.json``
   The 11.9 m STL mill slice with the bidisperse rock/steel charge of the
   existing ``sic_dataset`` (11,581 rock, 3,195 steel balls).
``sag_slice_lifters.json``
   Same charge in a parametric mill with 64 lifters and frictionless slice
   end walls.

Check a scenario before spending DEM time on it:

.. code-block:: python

   from bppm_dem_sm.simulation.scenario import load_scenario

   s = load_scenario("configs/simulation/sag_slice_lifters.json")
   print(s.checks())    # critical speed, fill level J, Rayleigh dt, lifter gap, ...
   print(s.warnings())  # e.g. dt above the Rayleigh step, speed outside 60-85% critical

Stages
------

``run_simulation.py`` runs five stages and writes a checkpoint after each:

1. ``build`` -- materials, mill (STL or parametric shell with lifters), end
   walls, Hertz-Mindlin engines, and ``dt = dt_safety x`` the Rayleigh step.
2. ``fill`` -- the charge is poured in chord-box batches (damped).
3. ``settle`` -- damped settling until the unbalanced force is small.
4. ``spinup`` -- undamped rotation from rest until the charge
   centre-of-mass angle and the drive power stop changing between
   consecutive windows (steady state).
5. ``record`` -- frame CSVs every ``record.frame_interval_s`` for
   ``record.duration_s``, starting at steady state.

Running
-------

.. code-block:: bash

   bppm-dem-sm dem-sim --scenario configs/simulation/sag_slice_lifters.json \
       --run-dir data/raw/yade_runs/sag_slice_lifters --threads 16

   # Resume from the settle checkpoint (e.g. after changing spin-up settings):
   bppm-dem-sm dem-sim --run-dir data/raw/yade_runs/sag_slice_lifters --from-stage spinup

   # Watch it in the YADE viewer:
   bppm-dem-sm dem-sim --scenario configs/simulation/smoke_test.json --gui

From Python:

.. code-block:: python

   from bppm_dem_sm.simulation.launcher import launch_simulation

   result = launch_simulation(
       scenario="configs/simulation/smoke_test.json",
       run_dir="data/raw/yade_runs/smoke_test",
       threads=4,
   )
   print(result.returncode)  # nonzero exit codes are returned, not raised

``FileNotFoundError`` is raised when neither ``yade`` nor ``yadedaily`` is on
``PATH``; an invalid scenario raises ``ValueError`` before YADE starts.

Outputs
-------

Everything lands in the run directory:

``manifest.json``
   The full scenario, derived checks and warnings, YADE version, ``dt``,
   threads, and per stage: wall time, simulated time span, iterations and
   outcome (inventory, settle balance, revolutions to steady state, frames).
``mill_log.csv``
   One row per ``record.monitor_interval_s``: charge angle (all, small,
   large), kinetic energy, drive torque and power, largest overlap.
``frames/frame_00000.csv`` ...
   ``id, x, y, z, r, m, vx, vy, vz`` -- the input of
   :doc:`data_processing`. ``frames_index.csv`` gives each frame's exact time.
``checkpoints/<stage>.yade.gz``
   YADE scenes to resume from or open in the viewer.

As a pipeline stage
-------------------

.. code-block:: python

   from bppm_dem_sm import run_experiment_pipeline

   results = run_experiment_pipeline(
       do_simulate=True,
       dem_scenario="configs/simulation/sag_slice_lifters.json",
       dem_run_dir="data/raw/yade_runs/sag_slice_lifters",
       do_predict=False, do_metrics=False, do_visualization=False,
   )
   print(results["dem_simulation"].returncode)

Point ``raw_data_dir`` at the run's ``frames/`` directory for ``do_process``.

Backends
--------

``backend="yade"`` is the only implemented backend. ``backend="blaze"``
(:mod:`bppm_dem_sm.simulation.blaze_dem`) is a placeholder and raises
``NotImplementedError``.
